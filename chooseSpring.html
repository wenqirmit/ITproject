            It's a great Spring day to go outside and admire the nature around you. You decide to go for a walk around your local park whilst taking in your surroundings.
            You hear in the conversations of the people around you talking about a special event going on at the centre of the park. Interested, you make your way over to the commotion.
            When you reach the event, it turns out to be a beautiful cherry blossom show!

            A worker at the park seemed to be handing out some pamphlets, so you decide to take one. You open up the pamphlet to read, but what was on the paper surprised you.
            <a href="springChoices.html">This</a> is what the paper reads.
