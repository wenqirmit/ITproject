<h4>Why the Four Seasons</h4>
    <p>The Earth's axis is slightly tiltedi n relation to its orbit around the Sun. This is why we have seasons.</p>
    <p>Both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere have the same four meteorological seasons: spring, summer, fall (known as autumn in other parts of the world), and winter, all three months long.</p>
    <p>Breaking the year into four seasons roughly the same length makes it easier for meteorologists to compare weather patterns.</p>
    <br>
<h3>Meteorological Seasons</h3>

<p>According to the meteorological definition, the seasons begin on the first day of the months that include the equinoxes and solstices. In the Northern Hemisphere, for example,</p>

<ul>
    <li>spring runs from March 1 to May 31;</li>	
    <li>summer runs from June 1 to August 31;</li>
    <li>fall (autumn) runs from September 1 to November 30; and</li>
    <li>winter runs from December 1 to February 28 (February 29 in a leap year.></li>
</ul>

   <p>The meteorological seasons in the Southern Hemisphere are also opposite to those in the Northern Hemisphere:</p>

<ul>
    <li>spring starts September 1 and ends November 30;</li> 
    <li>summer starts December 1 and ends February 28 (February 29 in a leap year;</li>
	<LI>fall (autumn) starts March 1 and ends May 31; and</LI>
	<li>winter starts June 1 and ends August 31;</li>   
</ul>
